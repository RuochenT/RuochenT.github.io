									<h1>Curious, open-minded,<br />
									humble, and confident</h1>
									<p>Growing up in Thailand, I spent a lot of time doing Thai boxing, playing tennis, and going on a trip to nearby islands to play stand-up paddleboarding with my family and friends.<br />
										I started volunteering to help farmers in suburban areas of Thailand twice a year since I was in high school. <br />
										In order to learn more about myself and the world outside of Thailand, I began solo traveling since I was 19 years old. I have been to 11 countries, lived in 3 countries, and still counting!</p>

								<p>"My goal is not to wake up at forty with the bitter realization that I've wasted my life on a job I hated."<br />
									I love numbers and puzzles since I was a kid. So, I decided to pursue a Bachelor in Business in Accounting to study what I love.
									I discovered the potential of big data and machine learning models in generating insights and assisting companies in achieving their goals.
									This realization motivated me to take online courses and obtain an internship as a data analyst, where I collected, cleaned, and analyzed data for the company.
									Data became my passion, so I decided to pursue a master's degree in Data Science and Marketing Analytics at Erasmus University in 2022.
									While studying at Erasmus, I learned how to manage, clean, select the appropriate data, and utilize machine learning and deep learning models to answer research questions, using tools such as R, Python, and MATLAB.
									My academic journey has enabled me to work on several projects. Currently, I am working on a cold start problem in a user-based recommender system by utilizing transformer models to predict ratings from reviews and solve the issue. <br />
								"Therefore, I want to follow my passion by doing what I believe in and learning every day to be the best in data field."<br />
